I am a 3rd year PhD student at the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), supervised by [Prof. Ana Klimovic](https://anakli.inf.ethz.ch/). I am interested in Systems for Machine Learning. Currently, I am working on increasing GPU utilization and fault tolerance of ML workloads. During my PhD I have completed internships in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/) and [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/#About%20Us). I obtained a MSc degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich, and a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en).
